# D-Board: Ortholinear Android Keyboard

Custom Android keyboard with true ortholinear (grid) layout for improved typing ergonomics.

## Problem
Standard mobile keyboards use staggered QWERTY layouts inherited from mechanical typewriters—designed to prevent key jams, not optimize finger movement on touchscreens.

## Solution
D-Board arranges keys in a perfect grid, eliminating unnecessary lateral finger movement and creating more predictable muscle memory.

## Features
- ✅ Full alphabet ortholinear layout
- ✅ Dual-width space bars for thumb access
- ✅ Navigation arrows
- ✅ Light/dark themes
- 🚧 Number row (in development)
